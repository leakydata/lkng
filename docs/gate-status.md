# Phase 0 gate status

Live log of the three go/no-go gates from PLAN.md. Update as evidence lands.

## Gate 1 — Eviction (do fresh contracts survive?)

**Setup (2026-07-31):**

- Published `hello-lkng` (grow-set contract, 34-byte state) to mainnet:
  `DcxbCZAiajvVpDk2dKmAVCCCiopVJ23TQoWqqkw1DaPT`, from the resident node
  (`:7509`). Round-trip verified byte-identical at publish time.
- Second node ("node2", `:7510`, own config/data dirs, **not** the
  publisher, no subscription) launched as the honest observer.
- `scripts/gate1-probe.sh` logs three series every 30 min to
  `tests/simulation/gate1-probe.csv`:

| Series | Via | Measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline_popular` | publisher node HTTP | control: many-subscriber contract (Delta UI) |
| `fresh_zero_subscriber` | publisher node (`:7509`) | local retention on the publishing peer |
| `fresh_from_node2` | node2 (`:7510`) | **true network retention — the Gate 1 number** |

**First samples:** all three series `200`; node2 fetched the fresh contract
from the network in **0.83 s** cold, ~0.08 s warm. A zero-subscriber,
zero-demand contract is retrievable across the network today.

**What is NOT yet answered:** survival over days as hosting budgets fill and
demand-ordered eviction bites (the design doc's whole point), and survival
while the *publisher is offline* — the real dating-app scenario. Next steps:
let the series accumulate ≥1 week; then stop the publisher node for 24 h and
watch `fresh_from_node2`; then repeat during higher network load.

**Verdict: OPEN — early signal positive.**

## Gate 2 — Android node

- **CROSS-COMPILE PASSES (2026-07-31): unmodified freenet-core 0.2.116
  builds for `aarch64-linux-android` with ZERO code changes.** 4m46s build,
  52 MB unstripped → **36 MB stripped** ELF PIE. No patches, no upstream
  work needed for compilation — the plan's "may require upstream work"
  risk did not materialize at this stage.
- Recipe: `freenet-core` pins Rust 1.94.0 (`rust-toolchain.toml`); the
  pinned toolchain needs its own Android std
  (`rustup target add aarch64-linux-android --toolchain 1.94.0`) — without
  it every crate fails with a missing-std cascade. Then NDK r27c clang as
  linker/CC/CXX (`aarch64-linux-android24-clang`), `llvm-ar` as AR.
- Remaining half of the gate: run it **on a device** — child process from
  an APK, app-private dirs, loopback bind, survive `am kill`. Needs
  hardware or an emulator (and an x86_64 build for the latter).
- **fdev bug found (affects any contract dev):** `fdev build` panics
  "Could not find workspace root" unless `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is set — its
  fallback walks the *compile-time* `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` of fdev itself
  (`crates/fdev/src/util.rs:103`). Also: contracts must be their own
  workspace root (`[workspace]` in the contract's Cargo.toml), matching
  Mail/Delta convention. Worth an upstream issue.

**Verdict: OPEN — build running.**

## Gate 3 — Duty-cycled contribution

Not started. Depends on Gate 2 binary. Plan: drive node between
contributing and leaf across charge/network transitions on a real device;
watch ring stability and state integrity.

**Verdict: NOT STARTED.**

## Environment notes

- Resident node `:7509` (network mode) — also serves River/Delta locally.
- node2 `:7510` / network port 31338, dirs under `~/.cache/lkng-node2/`.
- Toolchain: Rust 1.97.1 (workspace) + 1.94.0 (freenet-core pin),
  stdlib 0.8.5, fdev 0.3.278, freenet 0.2.116, NDK r27c, JDK 21+25.
